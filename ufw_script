# This script will patch, update and automatically engage UFW for Debian based Linux systems.
# Adapt the script as necessary for you hosts needs. The default configuration Allows ports 
# 22, 80, and 443 (webhosting) but can easily be configured but removing “#” from lines as 
# you see fit.


# First we will patch the system 

echo "y" | sudo apt-get update

echo "y" | sudo apt-get upgrade

echo "y" | sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

# Check ufw is installed and if not install Uncomplicated firewall (ufw)

which ufw
if [ $? != 0 ] 
then
	echo "y" | sudo apt-get install ufw
fi

# Allow ssh through the firewall before it is enabled to prevent disconnect

sudo ufw allow ssh 

sudo ufw allow 22

# enable Ubuntu firewall

echo "y" | sudo ufw enable

# Allow http and https

sudo ufw allow http 

sudo ufw allow http

sudo ufw allow 80

sudo ufw allow 443

#To enable ftp delete "#" from the beginning of the lines below

#sudo ufw enable ftp

#sudo ufw enable 21

# To allow specific port ranges delete the "#" from the required lines below. and add the ranges required

#sudo ufw allow 1:1000/tcp

#sudo ufw allow 1000:2000/udp

# To allow specific IP's delete the "#" from the lines below

#sudo ufw allow from 10.10.10.10 

# To finish we check the status of UFW to confirm that the relevent ports are ALLOWED.

sudo ufw status | grep -E '22.*ALLOW|80.*ALLOW|443.*ALLOW'

echo "$(tput setaf 1)Check out $(tput setab 7)www.darkersec.com$(tput sgr 0)$(tput setaf 2) for more useful stuff$(tput sgr 0)"

# If you've not patch your system in while this could take up to an hour so have a cuppa
# tea and when you return check the output to confirm that the firewall is active and the 
# relevant ports are open.
